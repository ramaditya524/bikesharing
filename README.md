## Summary

### Additional visualizations
I would add the following visualizations:
* Top 10 locations of Citi Bike in terms of user volume - this will help us know where to focus resources and ensure bike availability
* User trips by age - this will help us understand the core customer of Citi Bike and can help create targeted programs to increase rider numbers
