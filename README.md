# NYC Citi Bike

## Overview
We are helping Citi Bike create a presentation to pitch to investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a good business idea. We are using Citi Bike bikesharing data from New York city to create a presuasive story that will satisfy investors about the plausibility of a successfull business in Des Moines.

## Results
We have created a few visualization to solidy the pitch with analysis on bike trips.

### Checkout times
To start off, we show bike trip durations and we can see that most trips are short and are used for short distances to save time over walking. The trend holds the same across different genders as well.

### Trips by weekday
We can see that usage is high during peak hours, especially evening peak hours. The usage is also highest on thursday followed by the other weekdays.

### Trips by usertype
Subscribing customers are 10X more likely to use the bikesharing program over non-subscribing customers.

### Trips by start and end locations
Grand central station has the largest volume in terms of bike rides. This is probably due to the fact that it is the biggest transit hub in the greater NYC area.

## Summary
Thursdays followed by other weekdays have the highest number of bike rides, most of which are short ones and Grand Central terminal is where the highest trips of trips start and end.

### Additional visualizations
I would add the following visualizations:
* Top 10 locations of Citi Bike in terms of user volume - this will help us know where to focus resources and ensure bike availability
* User trips by age - this will help us understand the core customer of Citi Bike and can help create targeted programs to increase rider numbers
